# Web Toolbox

## 10.0.0
- This version is compatible with the Digipolis toolbox errors_aspnetcore v5.3.0-maintenance.
- The Digipolis toolbox errors_aspnetcore changed because of new API design guidelines: property ExtraInfo should be used instead of ExtraParameters in the Error model.

## 9.2.1
- when no port is found in request-url, no default port is used when building paged result links (previously port 80 was added by default)

## 9.2.0

- added PagingStrategy property to PageOptions and refactoring extension methods "ToPagedResult" to take strategy into account
- refactoring extension methods "ToPagedResult" for PageSortOptions to reuse extension methods of parent class PageOptions
- update unit tests

## 9.1.0

- Removed unnecessary DeserializationPagedResult, JsonConvertor and ISchemaFilter: the same result can be achieved with simple inheritance.
- PagedResult<T> changed to use inheritance, kept for backwards compatibility.
- Added new PagedResult<T, EmbeddedT> and Embedded<T> for correct HAL property name.
- Added new action to ValuesController demonstrate the difference between the two PagedResults. 
- Added EmbeddeValueDto to demonstrate the use of EmbeddedT.
- Removed StringExtensions: ToCamelCase only used for camelcasing bodyparameter names (and contained private extension methods); 
	now all parameter names are corrected in consistent way in 1 pass.
- Updated EndPointPathsAndParamsToLower to reflect this.
- Added new ToPagedResult<T, EmbeddedT> to PageOptionsExtensions, with less parameters => values from ActionContextDescriptor.
- Updated GenerateLink to include all query parameters, not just the Page(Sort)Options.
- Updated unit tests.
